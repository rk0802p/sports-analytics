- **npm** or **yarn** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### üîë Step 1: Get Your API Key (Required)

**You need a Football-Data.org API key to use this platform:**

1. **Visit**: [Football-Data.org](https://www.football-data.org/client/register)
2. **Register** for a free account
3. **Verify your email** and log in
4. **Get your API key** from your dashboard
5. **Copy the API key** - you'll need it in the next step

### üöÄ Step 2: Clone & Setup Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd sports-analytics

# Or if you already have the project, navigate to it
cd sports-analytics
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Backend

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd Backend

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the setup script to configure your API key
python setup.py
```

**Or manually create `.env` file:**
```bash
# Create .env file in Backend directory
echo "FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
```

### üéØ Step 4: Start Backend Server

```bash
# Make sure you're in the Backend directory
cd Backend

# Start the FastAPI server
python api.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO:     Started server process [xxxx]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**‚úÖ Backend is running when you see:**
- Server started on `http://localhost:8000`
- No error messages
- API documentation available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### üåê Step 5: Start Frontend

**Open a new terminal window/tab:**

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start React development server
npm start
```

**Expected output:**
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.x.x:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

**‚úÖ Frontend is running when you see:**
- Browser opens automatically to `http://localhost:3000`
- Football Analytics Platform loads without errors
- You can see the main dashboard

## üîç Verification & Testing

### Test Backend API

# Test if backend is responding
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Expected response:
# {"message": "Football Analysis API is running!"}

# Test teams endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/teams
```

### Test Frontend
1. **Open browser** to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Check navigation tabs** - Teams, Matches, Player Analysis
3. **Click on a team** to see team details
4. **Navigate to Player Analysis** tab
5. **Select a team** to view players

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Port 8000 already in use:**
```bash
# Find process using port 8000
netstat -ano | findstr :8000  # Windows
lsof -i :8000                 # Mac/Linux

# Kill the process or use different port
python api.py --port 8001
```

**API key not found:**
```bash
# Check if .env file exists
ls -la Backend/.env

# Verify API key in .env file
cat Backend/.env

# Re-run setup
cd Backend
python setup.py
```

**Python packages missing:**
```bash
# Reinstall requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Or install individually
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dotenv
```

### Frontend Issues

**Port 3000 already in use:**
```bash
# React will automatically suggest a different port
# Or manually specify:
PORT=3001 npm start
```

**Dependencies not installed:**
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Build errors:**
```bash
